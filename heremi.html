    “hello friends"....
My name is vaishnavi samadhan survase, and I am a fresher Python Full Stack Developer.

I have completed my training in Python Full Stack Development, where I gained hands-on experience in Python, Django/Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL. I am comfortable working on both frontend and backend development, and I understand how to build responsive user interfaces and connect them with backend logic and databases.

During my learning, I worked on projects such as projects, e.g., a CRUD web application, blog system, or e-commerce website], where I implemented user authentication, database operations, and REST APIs. These projects helped me understand real-world application development and improved my problem-solving skills.

I am a quick learner, highly motivated, and eager to apply my skills in a professional environment. I am looking for an opportunity where I can grow as a developer, contribute to the team, and continuously enhance my technical knowledge.”
